# LibraryDatabaseProject

This is a project that simulates the workings of a library database management system.

In this program, users are able to make an account for themselves at the library with a username 
and password. They are able to search for and place holds on books. Users interact with the database 
through user_script.py

Librarians are able to make an account where they are able to execute withdrawls and returns of books. 
Librarians interact with the database through librarian_script.py
